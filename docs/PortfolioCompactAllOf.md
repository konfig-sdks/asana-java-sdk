A *portfolio* gives a high-level overview of the status of multiple initiatives in Asana. Portfolios provide a dashboard overview of the state of multiple projects, including a progress report and the most recent [project status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) update. Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 500 items and, like projects, a max of 20 custom fields.
