*Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the `status_update` resource.* A *project status* is an update on the progress of a particular project, and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates include both text describing the update and a color code intended to represent the overall state of the project: \"green\" for projects that are on track, \"yellow\" for projects at risk, and \"red\" for projects that are behind.
